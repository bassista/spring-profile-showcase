# Spring profile showcase

The purpose of this showcase is to demonstrate how easy it is to customize how a Spring application context starts. See [this blog post](http://blog.springsource.com/2011/02/15/spring-3-1-m1-unified-property-management/) for an excellent introduction.

Our goal is to enable a set of profile(s) based on a properties file loaded from the classpath.
